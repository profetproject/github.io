  cv: "Christophs' research focus lies mainly in the field of modern cryptographic building blocks, in particular, in form of identity-based 
  and attribute-based encryption as well as digital signatures. On the application level, he is mainly interested in modern connected systems with an 
  emphasis on enhanced security features (e.g., forward secrecy) and resource-asymmetric devices (e.g., the Internet of Things)."

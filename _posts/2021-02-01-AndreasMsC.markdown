<p class="blockquote" align="justify">Andreas (see <a href="https://profet/members" target="_blank">here</a>) will join the project as a master student in February and will work with us for the next six months. He previously did two summer internships at AIT and will continue his research with a focus on privacy aspects in authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocols. In particular he will look at the security and privacy properties from the two perspectives of provable security and
formal methods.</p>

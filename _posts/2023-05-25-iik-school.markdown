The Lecture is scheduled Thursday 25 May 14:00-17:00 and the abstract is as follows:

<p class="blockquote" align="justify">With increasing use of online services the protection of the privacy of users becomes more and more
important. Cryptography offers exciting primitives such as zero-knowledge proofs and advanced signature schemes, which allow to provide a high level of privacy protection. The recent trend towards decentralization and reduction of trust in central authorities poses a number of novel challenges for these primitives. We will take a look at motivating examples, concepts in privacy-preserving cryptography and take a closer look at concrete primitives, advances and open problems.</p>
